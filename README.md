# Commodities, Supercycles, and the American Revolution
Most supercycles identified in working commodities datasets from 1800-2023 show supercycles caused by warfare--including the Napleonic Wars, Civil War, World War I, World War II, and the Cold War (although it could be contested that the depreciation of the dollar upon the removal of the fixed-exchange rate caused this supercycle)--except the recent supercycle from 2005-2013. I identify a new supercycle from 1770-1790, and look to see if the American Revolution was causal for this supercycle, or if constant shifts in monetary regimes over this time period (and frequent re-defining of coinage standards) caused increases in commodities prices. 

# Data
This paper uses data from archival resources in the Historical Society of Pennsylvania and secondary source materials. Archival materials with price figures recorded and cleaned include The Logan Family Papers, 1664-1871, the McCall Family Papers, 1764-1891, and the Orr, Dunlap & Glenholme Letterbook, 1767-1769. Secondary sources include 
Anne Bezanson's "Prices and Inflation during the American Revolution: Pennsylvania, 1770-1790" (1951) and Anne Bezanson, R.D. Gray, and M. Hussey, "Prices in Colonial Pennsylvania." (1935)

The dataset includes price levels and indices on beaf, bread, corn, flour, gunpowder, molasses, pitch, pork, rice, salt, rum, staves, sugar, tar, turpentine, wheat, whine, copper, silver, chocolate, coffee, corn, indigo, iron bar, and leather.

For inference on the cause of this supercycle, this paper examines both number of death count during the Revolutionary War, as well as devaluation of local currencies because of changes in currency standards. Mark R. Beissinger of Princeton University compiled data violent episodes in the revolutionary war here (https://mbeissinger.scholar.princeton.edu/revolutionary-episodes-dataset). We use this dataset, as well as Grubb (2022) on coinage regime changes to test casuality.
